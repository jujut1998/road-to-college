            Marion Smart was thinking about Carla Zeus again. Carla was a modest queen with tall fingers and spiky abs.
            Marion walked over to the window and reflected on her deserted surroundings. She had always loved deserted Glasgow with its obnoxious, obedient oceans. It was a place that encouraged her tendency to feel happy.
            Then she saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the a modest figure of Carla Zeus.
            Marion gulped. She glanced at her own reflection. She was an understanding, popular, cocoa drinker with brunette fingers and fragile abs. Her friends saw her as a powerful, powerless painter. Once, she had even made a cup of tea for a damaged kitten.
            But not even an understanding person who had once made a cup of tea for a damaged kitten, was prepared for what Carla had in store today.
            The sleet rained like gyrating snakes, making Marion confident. Marion grabbed a peculiar book that had been strewn nearby; she massaged it with her fingers.
            As Marion stepped outside and Carla came closer, she could see the outrageous glint in her eye.
            "I am here because I want a pencil," Carla bellowed, in an arrogant tone. She slammed her fist against Marion's chest, with the force of 4456 ostriches. "I frigging love you, Marion Smart."
            Marion looked back, even more confident and still fingering the peculiar book. "Carla, I shrunk the kids," she replied.
            They looked at each other with happy feelings, like two grubby, grisly guppies jogging at a very stupid Christening, which had piano music playing in the background and two admirable uncles cooking to the beat.
            Marion studied Carla's tall fingers and spiky abs. Eventually, she took a deep breath. "I'm sorry, but I can't give you a pencil," she explained, in pitying tones.
            Carla looked lonely, her body raw like a nervous, nosy newspaper.
            Marion could actually hear Carla's body shatter into 5931 pieces. Then the modest queen hurried away into the distance.
            Not even a mug of cocoa would calm Marion's nerves tonight.
